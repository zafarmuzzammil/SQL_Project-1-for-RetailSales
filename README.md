# SQL_Project-1-for-RetailSales
This is my first SQL project analyzes retail sales data to solve real business questions around revenue, customers, categories, time trends, and performance. I used advanced SQL concepts including CTEs, aggregations, filtering, and ranking to extract insights such as top customers, best months, and shift-wise order behavior.
